Simon Says: Implement Simon Memory game using Tkinter in
Python that will display a window with four buttons, each
representing a color (red, blue, green, yellow). The game will
randomly generate a sequence of colors and play them one by
one. The task is to remember the sequence and click the buttons
in the correct order. The game will keep track of the score and
display it on the screen. If you make a mistake, the game will end,
and the final score will be displayed. The program includes a
Reset button for initiating a new game.
